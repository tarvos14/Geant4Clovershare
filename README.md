# Geant4Clovershare
This code includes analysis software used to analyze data from a 7Be coulex scattering experiment performed at the University of Notre Dame.
 Most of the software is written in C++, usually using Root libraries and some Geant4.
 The code is working for the most part, but still in testing phase, as no complete data set has been analyzed with it yet.
 Any analysis codes that have a "7Li" in front of them were used to analyse a 7Li sister experiment and should be mostly identical to the 7Be data.
The Geant4 codes are altered from codes written by Anna Simon.
